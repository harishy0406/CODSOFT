            <h2>What is Football?</h2>
            <p>
                Football, also known as soccer in some countries, 
                is a globally popular sport played between two teams of eleven players each. 
                The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The primary objective is to score by getting 
                the ball into the opposing team's goal. Football is governed by a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game, 
                and it is played at both amateur and professional levels across the world. The sport is celebrated for its simplicity,
                 requiring minimal equipment—just a ball and a field—making it accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. 
                 It has a rich history and cultural significance in many countries, often serving as a unifying force and a source of national pride.

                agility and speed, crucial for both offensive and defensive maneuvers; and the diverse roles of players, such as strikers,
                 midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers, each with specific responsibilities. The sport also features dramatic moments, 
                 from breathtaking goals to crucial saves, often evoking intense emotions and passionate reactions from fans around the world.
